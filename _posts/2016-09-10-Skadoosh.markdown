description: Most Android platform developers have many problems, like <b>slow internet</b> or even <b>low bandwidth</b>. Due to this, they are unable to sync the big chunk of Android source codes from their respective repositories. Hence, most of the new and learning developers just fail at the first step which is downloading the source code!<br><br>So, I started this project where people needing the sources just submit a pull request of they manifest required. After it is merged, skadoosh automates the downloading, compressing and uploading of the sources to AndroidFileHost where the developers can download the highly compressed sources. This is done via a webhook and <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> which keeps watching for changes on my repository. Result is a source tarball having a size which is much smaller than the stuff synced manually.<br><br>Why name it "<b>Skadoosh</b>"?<br> Well, as the urban dictionary defines it, it is a term used to do stuff at one go. And I love pandas. Hence.
