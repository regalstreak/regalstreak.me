description: <b>halogenOS</b> is a new generation, cutting-edge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" >Android</a> ROM based on <a href="https://www.codeaurora.org/">Code Aurora Forum's releases</a>. Started back in April 2016 by me and a few friends as an argument towards heavily bloated and complicated ROMs, this ROM has spread to numerous android devices becoming quite popular. We focus largely on battery enhancement and performance. The feature set of halogenOS is quite basic as we did not want to bloat this ROM as the others keeping it simple and sweet.
